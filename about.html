                <p class="fade-in">I am Saranya Satheesh, a passionate designer dedicated to creating meaningful, inclusive, 
                    and impactful user experiences. With a deep appreciation for research-driven design, I focus on 
                    understanding people’s needs and behaviors to develop solutions that are both accessible and empowering. 
                    <br><br>
                    I strongly believe that design should be inclusive and representative of diverse voices. That’s why I 
                    incorporate research methodologies that emphasize co-creation, empathy, and appreciation—ensuring that users 
                    are not just subjects of study but active participants in the design process.
